            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 in Erode, Tamil Nadu, into a Tamil Brahmin 
                Iyengar family. His early life was marked by hardship, with the loss of his siblings and the 
                family's frequent moves between Kumbakonam and Madras (now Chennai). Ramanujan displayed a 
                remarkable aptitude for mathematics from a young age. By the age of 11, he had surpassed the 
                mathematical knowledge of two college students who lodged at his home. At 13, he mastered advanced 
                trigonometry from S. L. Loney’s book and began formulating sophisticated theorems on his own.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan's formal education was both remarkable and unconventional. After showing
                exceptional mathematical talent at a young age, he excelled in school, earning top marks in subjects
                like arithmetic and geometry. He attended Town Higher Secondary School, where he first
                encountered formal mathematics and quickly surpassed his peers. However, his obsession with
                mathematics led to difficulties in other subjects. While he received a scholarship to study at
                Government Arts College in Kumbakonam, his singular focus on math caused him to fail in non-
                mathematical subjects, resulting in the loss of his scholarship. He later enrolled at Pachaiyappa's
                College in Madras but again failed due to his lack of interest in subjects outside mathematics.
                Despite not obtaining a degree, Ramanujan continued his independent mathematical research,
                eventually gaining recognition for his extraordinary genius.</p>

            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, particularly in number theory,
                continued fractions, and infinite series. One of his most famous results is the Ramanujan-Hardy number,
                1729, known as the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. He developed
                remarkable formulas for partition functions and made significant advances in understanding modular forms.
                Ramanujan's infinite series for π, along with his work on mock theta functions, continue to influence modern
                mathematics and theoretical physics. His innovative work, much of it developed independently, laid the foundation
                for several advanced mathematical fields.
